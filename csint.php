<xmp class="si">
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

<h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
<xmp class="si">
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

<h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
<xmp class="si">
The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
